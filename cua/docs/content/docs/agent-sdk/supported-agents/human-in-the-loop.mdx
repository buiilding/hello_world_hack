title: Human-In-The-Loop
description: Use humans as agents for evaluation, demonstrations, and interactive control
---

The Agent SDK provides a human tool, with native support for using a human-in-the-loop as a way to evaluate your environment, tools, or to create demonstrations. You can use it by doing `grounding_model+human/human` or `human/human` directly.

## Getting Started

To start the human agent tool, simply run:

```bash
python -m agent.human_tool
```

The UI will show you pending completions. Select a completion to take control of the agent.

## Usage Examples

### Direct Human Agent

```python
from agent import ComputerAgent
from agent.computer import computer

agent = ComputerAgent(
    "human/human",
    tools=[computer]
)

async for _ in agent.run("Take a screenshot, analyze the UI, and click on the most prominent button"):
    pass
```

### Composed with Grounding Model

```python
agent = ComputerAgent(
    "huggingface-local/HelloKKMe/GTA1-7B+human/human",
    tools=[computer]
)

async for _ in agent.run("Navigate to the settings page and enable dark mode"):
    pass
```

## Features

The human-in-the-loop interface provides:

- **Interactive UI**: Web-based interface for reviewing and responding to agent requests
- **Image Display**: Screenshots with click handlers for direct interaction
- **Action Accordions**: Support for various computer actions (click, type, keypress, etc.)
- **Tool Calls**: Full OpenAI-compatible tool call support
- **Real-time Updates**: Smart polling for responsive UI updates

## Use Cases

- **Evaluation**: Have humans evaluate agent performance and provide ground truth responses
- **Demonstrations**: Create training data by having humans demonstrate tasks
- **Interactive Control**: Take manual control when automated agents need human guidance
- **Testing**: Validate agent, tool, and environment behavior manually
