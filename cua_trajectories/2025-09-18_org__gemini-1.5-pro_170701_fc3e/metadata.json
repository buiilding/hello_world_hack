The Orchestrator will then check the output for errors.\n\nThe \"check_firefox_open\" task will be sent to the GUI agent. The GUI agent will take a screenshot and return it to the Orchestrator.  The Orchestrator will analyze the screenshot to verify that Firefox has opened. If the success criteria aren't met, and retries remain, a retry will be attempted. If all retries are exhausted, the Orchestrator will halt and report failure.  Further tasks (e.g., navigating to a specific URL) will be planned and added to the task list after these initial steps are successful.  Specifically, if the \"check_firefox_open\" task fails repeatedly, subsequent retries might include more refined GUI instructions such as:\n\n* **Retry 1-3:** Try locating the Firefox window by title bar text \"Mozilla Firefox\" or similar.\n* **Retry 4-5:** Try locating a Firefox icon on the taskbar or dock and activating it to bring the window forward. This would require additional subtasks for the GUI agent.\n\n\nThis breakdown ensures that the Orchestrator can monitor progress, handle errors, and dynamically adjust the plan based on feedback from both the GUI and Programmer agents.\n"
